## Introduction

A significant security issue has been identified involving Google’s **MultiLogin** system. Cybercriminals are exploiting a hidden feature within Google’s authentication system to reactivate expired session cookies, granting them unauthorized access to user accounts. This article delves into the discovery of the exploit, its mechanisms, and its rapid adoption by malware families.

## What Are Session Cookies?

Session cookies are essential components of web browsers, storing login details to enable seamless user experiences. These cookies allow users to access websites without repeatedly entering login credentials. However, session cookies are designed to expire, limiting the risk of prolonged unauthorized access. The MultiLogin exploit bypasses this safeguard by reviving expired cookies.

## The Discovery of the MultiLogin Exploit

### Lumma and Rhadamanthys Malware

In November 2023, cybersecurity experts raised alarms about **Lumma** and **Rhadamanthys**, two information-stealing malware variants. These malicious tools utilize the MultiLogin exploit to regenerate Google session cookies, enabling persistent unauthorized access to user accounts.

## Understanding the MultiLogin Exploit

### What Is the MultiLogin Endpoint?

Google’s MultiLogin feature is designed to synchronize multiple Chrome accounts. It relies on account IDs and authentication tokens to manage login sessions. Unfortunately, cybercriminals have found ways to exploit this endpoint to retrieve and decrypt expired session tokens.

### Token Extraction and Cookie Regeneration

Attackers extract tokens and account identifiers (GAIA IDs) from compromised Chrome profiles. These stolen credentials are decrypted and used to regenerate expired session cookies, granting attackers ongoing access to victim accounts.

## The Growing Threat Landscape

### Malware Evolution

Initially utilized by **Lumma stealer** and **Rhadamanthys**, the MultiLogin exploit has since been adopted by other malware families, including **Stealc**, **Medusa**, **RisePro**, and **Whitesnake**. This widespread adoption underscores the exploit's effectiveness and the urgency of addressing it.

### Persistent Exploitation

Despite Google’s silent attempts to mitigate the exploit, malware developers have continued to adapt. For example, Lumma introduced additional encryption methods and SOCKS proxies to maintain the exploit's functionality.

## Mitigation Strategies for Users

To protect your Google accounts from the MultiLogin exploit, follow these proactive steps:

1. **Log out of all sessions**: Sign out of your Google account on all devices.
2. **Change your password**: Update your Google account password to invalidate existing authentication tokens.
3. **Revoke session access**: Use the Google devices page to manually revoke access for all logged-in sessions.

These steps help neutralize persistent access enabled by regenerated cookies.
