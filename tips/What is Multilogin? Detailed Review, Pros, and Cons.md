## 1. What is Multilogin?

**Multilogin** is an advanced antidetect browser that allows users to create and manage multiple accounts on a single device without detection by websites. Each profile created in Multilogin is equipped with unique browser fingerprint parameters, ensuring complete isolation between accounts. Additionally, Multilogin supports proxy integration, enabling different IP addresses for each profile to simulate independent devices across various networks.

Multilogin offers two proprietary browser engines:

Both engines support advanced features such as profile customization, team collaboration, and access to high-quality residential proxies.

## 3. Applications of Multilogin

### 3.1 Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate marketers often manage multiple accounts to share links and drive traffic. However, platforms can become suspicious of such activity. Multilogin eliminates this risk by providing unique browser profiles with distinct configurations and IP addresses, ensuring anonymity while targeting multiple audiences. Additionally, Multilogin supports API integration for automating account creation and maintenance.

### 3.2 E-commerce
Online sellers on platforms like Amazon, Etsy, and eBay often need multiple stores to cater to different customer segments. These platforms limit the number of accounts a user can create, but with Multilogin, you can manage multiple stores on the same device without detection. Each profile mimics an independent device, ensuring compliance with platform rules.

### 3.3 Online Advertising
For digital advertisers, creating multiple Google Ads or Facebook Ads accounts is essential for A/B testing and targeting diverse demographics. Multilogin enables advertisers to manage multiple advertising accounts without triggering detection mechanisms on platforms.
