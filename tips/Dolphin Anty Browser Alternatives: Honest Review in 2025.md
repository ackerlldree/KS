## Dolphin Anty Features

### 1. Social Media Automation

Dolphin Anty offers robust automation tools optimized for paid traffic ads. Key features include:

- **Automated Facebook Ad Campaigns:** A specialized tool for running ad campaigns at scale. However, this feature comes at an additional $99/month, separate from the base browser cost.
- **No-Code Automation:** Build custom scenarios for social media actions using a block-based system. Unfortunately, there are no pre-made scenarios or a marketplace for automation templates.

### 2. Mass Profile Actions

Dolphin makes managing multiple profiles efficient. Features include:

## Dolphin Anty: Updates and Support

### Updates

Dolphin provides frequent updates, but these are primarily announced via their Telegram channel rather than on their website. Some users report stability issues with prolonged use, which could be a concern for businesses requiring uninterrupted performance.

### Support Quality

Dolphin offers English-language support but response times can be inconsistent. While the browser has a loyal international following, it still caters heavily to the CIS market. Notably, Dolphin suffered a **major data breach in 2022**, affecting 15% of user profiles. Though the team compensated affected users, the incident raises concerns about its reliability.
