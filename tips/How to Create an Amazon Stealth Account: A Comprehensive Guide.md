# How to Create an Amazon Stealth Account: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Amazon's strict policies limit sellers to one account per user or household, making it challenging to manage multiple accounts or start fresh after a suspension. However, with the right tools and techniques, such as using antidetect browsers and proxies, you can create and manage Amazon stealth accounts effectively while maintaining your privacy.

In this guide, we’ll provide a step-by-step walkthrough to help you bypass Amazon’s restrictions and create a stealth account. By the end, you’ll have the knowledge to manage multiple accounts securely and stay compliant with Amazon's guidelines.

## What Is an Amazon Stealth Account?

Amazon allows only **one seller account per user or household**. While you can request permission to create a second account, approval is rare. This policy makes it difficult for sellers who:

- Were suspended, deactivated, or banned for violating Amazon’s terms.
- Need to run multiple accounts simultaneously for different purposes.

An Amazon stealth account, also known as a ghost account, is a workaround. It’s essentially a regular seller account with new and unique details, such as a different email address, bank account number, and browser fingerprint. This separation ensures the new account isn’t linked to your original account.

### Why You Might Need an Amazon Stealth Account

1. **Account Suspension or Ban**: If your original account was banned for rule violations, a stealth account allows you to continue selling.
2. **Multiple Accounts**: Running multiple accounts for different products or business ventures ensures operational flexibility.

## The Role of IP and Digital Fingerprints

Amazon tracks users through various methods, primarily your **IP address** and **digital fingerprint**. Here’s how:

1. **IP Address**: When you connect to Amazon, your IP address reveals your location. Amazon uses this information to identify linked accounts.
2. **Digital Fingerprint**: This includes details like your browser type, plugins, operating system, time zone, and more. These details create a unique digital profile, allowing Amazon to detect linked accounts even if the IP addresses are different.

To bypass these tracking methods, you’ll need to hide your IP address and modify your browser fingerprint using proxies and antidetect browsers.

## Essential Tools for Creating a Stealth Account

### 1. Proxy Services

Proxies hide your real IP address by routing your connection through a proxy server. This makes it appear as if you’re accessing Amazon from a different location. For stealth accounts, **residential proxies** and **mobile proxies** are recommended because they mimic real user activity, reducing the risk of detection.

**Tip**: Residential proxies are more cost-effective, while mobile proxies offer better anonymity.

### 2. Antidetect Browsers

Antidetect browsers, such as Multilogin, GoLogin, and Smartproxy’s X-Browser, are designed to mask your browser fingerprint. These tools allow you to create multiple unique browser profiles, each with a distinct fingerprint. This prevents Amazon from linking your accounts based on browser data.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up a Stealth Account

### Step 1: Create a Browser Profile
- Use an antidetect browser like **Multilogin** to set up a new browser profile.
- Ensure the operating system in the profile matches your actual OS for maximum anonymity.

### Step 2: Match Time Zone and Geolocation
- Adjust your browser settings to match the time zone and geolocation of your proxy’s IP address. This helps maintain consistency and avoids detection.

### Step 3: Configure Proxies
- Add residential or mobile proxies to your browser profile.
- Ensure the proxy’s location matches the billing address you’ll use for the stealth account.

### Step 4: Verify Your Settings
- Use tools like [Pixelscan](https://pixelscan.net) to check for inconsistencies in your browser fingerprint and IP address.

## Tips for Managing Stealth Accounts

1. **Warm Up Your Account**: Interact with Amazon as a regular user before selling. Browse products, add items to your cart, and revisit the site after a day or two.
2. **Use Real Information**: For registration, use real personal details, including a valid email address and bank account, to avoid verification issues.
3. **Consistent Settings**: Always log in using the same browser profile and proxy location to avoid triggering Amazon’s detection systems.
4. **Keep Detailed Notes**: Document all account parameters, including IP addresses, browser profiles, and login credentials, to stay organized.
