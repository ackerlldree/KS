# VMLogin Alternative for Multi-Accounting: Honest Review 2025

## Introduction

As we continue exploring multi-accounting browsers, today we dive into **VMLogin**, a Chinese-origin browser launched in 2020. Despite its availability, it has struggled to gain recognition outside of China and Vietnam.

**VMLogin**, also known as **Virtual Multi Login**, is marketed as a multi-accounting browser, allowing users to create virtual profiles instead of using multiple devices. It claims to be ideal for affiliate marketers, social media managers, and other professionals managing multiple accounts.

But is **VMLogin** worth it in 2025? Let’s explore its features, usability, and whether it stands up to competitors like **GoLogin**.

## VMLogin: Features and Usage Insights

### What VMLogin Offers
VMLogin promotes its ability to create **virtual browser profiles** that:
- Separate browsing environments.
- Protect browser fingerprints.
- Automate repetitive tasks, such as ad verification, competitor analysis, and web scraping via its API.

However, its practical usability and technical design often leave much to be desired.

### Registration and Onboarding
VMLogin's registration process lacks efficiency:
- No Google authentication for quick sign-up.
- Free trial activation requires contacting customer support, delaying the process.

While waiting for a response, users may turn to more accessible alternatives, such as **GoLogin**, which offers automatic trials without extra steps.

### First Impressions and User Interface
Upon launching VMLogin, the outdated design immediately stands out:
- The app operates as a fixed-size window without a full-screen option.
- The user interface is cluttered and unintuitive, with poorly visible buttons and confusing navigation.
- A new user might feel overwhelmed by the numerous settings, switches, and manual configurations required.

Moreover, **default browser profiles expose real device fingerprints**, requiring users to manually adjust settings to achieve proper anonymity.

### Proxy Management
VMLogin makes proxy setup cumbersome:
- Users must manually paste and verify proxy credentials for each profile, resulting in a tedious process for managing multiple profiles.
- The main profile table lacks customization options, making it harder to track key variables such as proxy or profile creation time.

## Key Challenges With VMLogin

### Fingerprint Protection
Fingerprint protection is critical for multi-accounting browsers, but VMLogin struggles in this area. Tests on tools like **Pixelscan.net** and **Iphey.com** reveal failures in masking key hardware and software identifiers, leaving users exposed.

### Team Collaboration
VMLogin supports team collaboration with features like:
- Profile sharing and permissions control.
- Grouping browser profiles into folders.

However, its usability is hindered by outdated design and limited organization options.

### Support and Updates
VMLogin’s support team operates within a limited time window (GMT+8, Monday-Friday), creating potential delays in resolving issues. While the platform receives monthly updates, the frequency is insufficient for addressing critical bugs and user feedback.

## GoLogin: A Superior Alternative

If you're looking for a more modern, user-friendly multi-accounting browser, **GoLogin** is a standout choice. Let's compare the two solutions across key factors.

### Registration and Onboarding
GoLogin simplifies the onboarding process:
- Quick sign-up via Google or email.
